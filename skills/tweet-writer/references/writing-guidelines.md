# Tweet Writing Guidelines

Proven framework for writing tweets that build audience and generate business opportunities.

## Core Philosophy

Post high-value content consistently. Brilliant insights don't automatically become great tweets - writing quality matters as much as content quality.

## The Five Essential Criteria

### 1. Genuinely Valuable

**Problem**: Recycled advice that's been said a thousand times won't make anyone stop scrolling.

**Solution**: Dig into your experience and pull out fresh insights. Things that haven't been beaten to death across the platform. Ideas that could genuinely shift how someone approaches their work or thinks about their business.

**Test**: Would I bookmark this if someone else wrote it? If no, keep working.

**Avoid**:
- Regurgitating advice floating around for years
- Generic shitposting (unless you're one of the rare wizards who can make it work)
- Stating obvious things without new angles

**Examples of fresh vs recycled**:
- ❌ "ChatGPT's new update is absolutely insane" (zero context)
- ✅ "How to write copy that sounds human with GPT-5.2:" + step-by-step process

### 2. Immediately Actionable

**Problem**: An insight without a blueprint is entertainment, not education.

**Solution**: Don't just notice something - teach people how to use it. Walk through the actual process step by step, line by line, exactly how to implement it in their workflow.

**Structure**:
- Start with "how to [specific outcome]:"
- Provide step-by-step process
- Make it usable TODAY, not eventually

**Why this works**: People follow you because you teach them systems, not because you pointed at something interesting. The tweets become your portfolio.

**Examples**:
- ❌ "This new feature is game-changing" (just pointing)
- ✅ "How to [specific outcome]: 1. [step] 2. [step] 3. [step]" (teaching system)

### 3. Natural Engagement

**Problem**: Begging for engagement ("like if you agree") makes you look desperate.

**Solution**: Structure tweets to naturally create replies and bookmarks.

#### For Bookmarks

Use hooks that trigger instinctive saves:
- "here's how"
- "how to"
- "do this"

People operate on autopilot - if the first line looks useful, they bookmark for later.

#### For Replies (Two Approaches)

**Option A - Strong opinion (controversial stance)**:
- Push your opinion harder
- Take clear stance: "X is better than Y, here's proof"
- People will argue or back you up - either way, engagement

**Option B - Open invitation (collaborative)**:
- Keep it slightly open
- "This is my workflow, curious if anyone's tested with [alternative]"
- Feels collaborative, people love sharing experiences

Both work - pick what fits the content.

**Avoid**:
- "Retweet if helpful"
- "Tag someone who needs this"
- Any explicit engagement begging

### 4. Ridiculously Easy to Read

**Problem**: People scroll at insane speeds. Messy structure = instant bounce.

**Hook requirements**:
- Short and punchy
- One line
- Clear value signal: "how to X" or "why X doesn't work" or "the X mistake"

**Formatting rules**:
- One sentence per line (creates rhythm, easier to process visually)
- Use lists: "-" or ">" or "1." for complex info
- White space matters (space between lines/sections gives eyes rest)
- No solid blocks of text (feels exhausting before reading)

**Language rules**:
- Conversational tone (mentor talking to students)
- Simplify everything: "use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate", "get better" not "optimize performance"
- Test: Could your 14-year-old cousin understand? If no, simplify more
- Goal: Someone who knows nothing about your field can still follow

**Examples**:
- ❌ Dense paragraph with complex words
- ✅ Short lines, simple words, clear structure with white space

### 5. Recognizable Style

**Problem**: Generic content blends into "content soup" - same hooks, same structure, same voice everywhere.

**Solution**: Develop patterns people can identify instantly.

**Style elements to establish**:
- Specific formatting patterns (e.g., always use ">" for processes)
- Consistent opening patterns
- Strategic fragments for emphasis
- Signature phrases ("tbh" before controversial takes)

**Balance**: Consistency without being formulaic
- Find 3-4 structural elements that feel natural
- Use them frequently
- Mix up order, change context, adapt to different topics
- Should feel like you, not like filling a template

**Result**: People recognize your tweets before seeing your name

## The Complete Flow

When you nail all five consistently:

1. **Audience respect**: People respect ideas, not just follower count
2. **Stop-scrolling effect**: Your name = instant attention
3. **Profile pulls**: Every tweet delivers clear insights + actionable steps
4. **Natural conversion**: When ready to sell, conversion is natural because you've been proving expertise publicly

They've experienced your teaching style through tweets. Hiring/buying feels like logical next step.

## Writing Checklist

Before posting, verify:
- [ ] Fresh insight (not recycled advice)
- [ ] Actionable system (not just observation)
- [ ] Natural engagement hook (bookmarkable + reply-worthy)
- [ ] Clean structure (one line per sentence, white space, simple words)
- [ ] Recognizable style (consistent patterns)
- [ ] Would I bookmark this? (honest test)

## Common Failure Patterns

1. **Brilliant but messy**: Great insight, poor writing → flops
2. **Well-written but recycled**: Clean structure, old advice → ignored
3. **Insightful but vague**: Good idea, no blueprint → entertainment only
4. **Actionable but complex**: Useful steps, hard to read → bounce
5. **Generic voice**: Correct everything, sounds like everyone → forgettable
